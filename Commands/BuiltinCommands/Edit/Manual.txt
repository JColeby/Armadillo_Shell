Edit Command:

    Syntax:
        edit <filepath>

    How to use:
        use arrow keys to move cursor
        ctrl+x - exits the document. will prompt you to save if needed
        ctrl+o - saves the file. unfortunately ctrl+s wouldn't work because windows is silly

    Additional info:
        if the provided filepath doesn't exist, a new file will be created at that location the next time you save.
        killing the command using ctrl+q will show the same prompts as ctrl+x before you exit.
