Process Command:
    will show all the processes currently running. Will by default hide processes that are running the same executable as
    another process so only one is shown.

    Syntax:
        process <flags>

    Flags:
        -a      Will show all processes that are running (i.e. doesn't hide processes that are running the same executable)
        -f      displays the full filepath
